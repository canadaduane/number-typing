# Typing Practice

My daughter needed a way to practice typing just the numbers (0-9) on the keyboard. There are a lot of crap typing websites out there. This takes it down to just the basics (no ads, no distractions, no tracking). This practice assumes that the goal is to use the number row on the keyboard, not a numerical keypad.

## Getting started

To practice typing, visit [https://canadaduane.github.io/number-typing](https://canadaduane.github.io/number-typing)

## Installation

This is a react app, so you should be able to do the following (assuming `node` and `yarn` are installed):

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
